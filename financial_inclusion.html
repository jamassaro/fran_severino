          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>In my final year of graduate studies at Parsons, The New School, I pursued a capstone project that combined my passions for financial inclusion and women's empowerment. I believed that addressing the intersection of these two critical areas could lead to impactful tools for empowering women through finance.</p>
          <h3>Project Overview</h3>
          <p>I conducted an in-depth research project to understand the financial needs and challenges faced by women, particularly those in marginalized communities. Through this project, I aimed to develop a comprehensive solution to promote financial inclusion and empowerment among women.</p>
          <h3>Research & Engagement</h3>
            <p>Interviews & Workshops: I conducted over 20 interviews with women through one-on-one conversations, group discussions, and workshops, including a workshop specifically for immigrant women starting their own small businesses.</p>
            <p>Research Locations: Interviews took place in locations where women sought financial advice, providing valuable insights into their needs and challenges.</p>

          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>Through my research and co-creation, I learned that women were already using agendas or notebooks to track sales, but lacked meaningful output.</p>
          <p>To address the financial challenges faced by women, I developed a combined solution:</p>
          <p>Booklet & Mobile App: A simple booklet for tracking annual sales, paired with a mobile app generating reports on sales, by organizing their information and adding an extra step, I provided valuable reports on sales, enabling data-driven decisions.</p>
          <h3>Methodology & Tactics Used</h3>
          <p>Primary & Secondary Research | Surveys | Interviews | Journey Map | Personas | Workshops | Prototyping | Co-Creation</p>
          <h3>Impact</h3>
          <p>This project demonstrates my ability to tackle complex social issues through design research and technology development, promoting financial inclusion and empowerment among women.</p>
