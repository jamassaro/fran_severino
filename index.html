        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          I am a strategic design specialist with over a decade of experience leading diverse projects in startups, non-profits, and for-profits.
          My passion lies in talking to people, research, creating exceptional customer experiences, and driving impactful social change.
          I currently manage client-facing NetSuite data migrations, ensuring efficiency and accuracy in our processes. I thrive in collaborative environments, 
          promoting teamwork and professional development. I hold a Master’s in Strategic Design and Management from Parsons, The New School, 
          and a degree in Design and Applied Arts from Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile.
          I’ve managed program deployment at The New School's Impact Entrepreneurship Initiative, developed methodologies for social 
          entrepreneurs at Socialab, and led strategic partnerships at FreshWater Solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          My capstone project focused on financial inclusion and women empowerment, creating a roadmap for impactful solutions.
          Currently, I'm part of the SPARCS initiative by CUNY, working on a community-driven design project to boost resident 
          wellbeing in NYC parks, specifically at my beloved Astoria Heights Playground.
          I am dedicated to leveraging my skills to foster social and business impact, 
          and I thrive in collaborative and innovative environments.

            <p>As design continues to evolve as a driving force for organizational transformation, it has become clear that a design-driven mindset is no longer a luxury, but a necessity for organizations to succeed. Design is now a catalyst for cultural change, and it's our responsibility as design thinkers to tackle complexity head-on, adopting a holistic approach to understand the broader context.</p>
            <p>This toolkit is a collection of design research methods, resources, and insights that I've curated from my own design thinking journey. It's a starting point for those seeking to integrate design methods into their problem-solving toolkit, and a resource for those looking to expand their existing toolkit. Within these pages, you'll find practical guidance on how to approach challenges from new angles, and how to harness the power of design to drive meaningful impact.</p>
